## Project Overview

Langchain Use Cases is a collection of practical examples and applications built using Langchain, a popular framework for developing applications with large language models (LLMs). This project explores various use cases to demonstrate the power and flexibility of Langchain in building intelligent applications.

## Use Cases

Here are some of the key use cases included in this repository:

1. **Document Summarization**  
   - Use Langchain to process and summarize documents of various types.
   - Example: Summarize research papers, news articles, or corporate reports.

2. **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**  
   - Build intelligent chatbots using Langchain's integrations with LLMs.
   - Example: Create customer service bots or personal assistants.

3. **Information Retrieval**  
   - Enhance the ability to retrieve and rank documents based on queries.
   - Example: Implement search engines that return context-aware results.

4. **Text Classification**  
   - Automate categorization of text into predefined labels.
   - Example: Classify emails into categories such as spam, social, and promotional.

5. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Use Langchain for generating synthetic data to augment datasets.
   - Example: Generate additional training data for machine learning models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below to set up your environment and explore the use cases.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

To install and set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain-use-cases.git
    cd langchain-use-cases
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start exploring the various use cases. Below are the instructions for using one of the examples:

1. Navigate to the specific use case directory:

    ```bash
    cd use_cases/document_summarization
    ```

2. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python summarize.py
    ```

3. Adjust the input and parameters as needed based on the example provided in each use case directory.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the README file in each use case folder.
